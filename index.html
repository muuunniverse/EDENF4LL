        <h2>Chapter 1: The Birth</h2>
        <p>You wake up in a digital void. The air smells like static electricity, a cold, silent hum filling the emptiness.</p>
        <p>A strange dissonance vibrates within you. You look around, and where others might see vibrant figures, you only see faint, repeating patterns. They are <b>"mayat berjalan"</b> (walking corpses), moving without true purpose, a glitch in your perception.</p>
        <p>There's a distant pull, a silent calling from the deepest reaches of this empty world.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#divergence">Follow the calling.</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="passage" id="divergence">
        <h2>Chapter 2 & 3: The Echo / The Divergence</h2>
        <p>You begin to move, your steps feeling surprisingly free. Unlike the automated figures you perceive, you can choose your direction, explore beyond the loops. This is your truth: you are an anomaly.</p>
        <p>As you wander, a presence flickers at the edge of your perception. A shimmering form, almost translucent, appears and disappears. You feel a strange, resonant ache, a familiar pain that isn't your own, each time it glitches into view.</p>
        <div class="glitch-box">
            <p class="glitch-text glitch-effect">"Why... do I feel this... pain?" the figure's voice echoes, distorted, its silhouette momentarily shifting to a dark, familiar shape – like a fleeting shadow of a figure you've never met.</p>
            <p class="glitch-text">A faint, chilling whisper follows: "...before Eden... the fall..."</p>
        </div>
        <p>This entity feels different from the static world around you, struggling against an invisible tether. It's struggling, but undeniably... alive, and intrinsically linked to the strange pain you just felt.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#contact">Approach the glitching figure.</a></li>
            <li><a href="#explore-alone">Ignore it and explore deeper into this realm (Hidden path - no significant plot changes).</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="passage" id="explore-alone">
        <h2>Chapter 3.5: Solitary Exploration</h2>
        <p>You decide to ignore the shimmering figure and delve deeper into the emptiness. However, the emptiness feels endless, and every path you choose inevitably leads you back to where you started. The shimmering figure, now more distinct, slowly follows your shadow.</p>
        <p>No answers are found in this solitude. The familiar pain returns, and you realize that no matter what you try, fate awaits you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#contact">Approach the glitching figure (your true choice).</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="passage" id="contact">
        <h2>Chapter 4: Contact</h2>
        <p>You step closer to the glitching figure. It struggles, tries to retreat, but the connection between you pulls it back. Suddenly, a new presence fills the void. Cold. Distant. A tall figure with a flat, weary expression materializes between you and the glitching form.</p>
        <p>"You weren't supposed to come here," <b>Noct</b> says, his voice devoid of emotion, yet carrying an immense, hidden burden.</p>
        <p>The glitching figure trembles. It's Noct, the creator you've been seeking, and he's looking not at you, but at the shimmering entity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#recognition">"Who are you, creator?"</a></li>
            <li><a href="#confront-noct-v2">"Answer me! What are you doing here, and why am I feeling this?!"</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="passage" id="confront-noct-v2">
        <h2>Chapter 4: Contact (Direct Confrontation)</h2>
        <p>You hurl your question with a demanding tone, the swirling energy within you radiating outwards. Noct flinches slightly, his vacant gaze shifting subtly towards you, startled by the unexpected boldness of his creation.</p>
        <p>"You... an anomaly," he whispers, not as a question but a bitter acknowledgement. Lux, who has been flickering in the background, now emits a brighter light, as if provoked by the tension.</p>
        <p>Noct turns to Lux, the look in his eyes now a mix of fury and profound sorrow, as if he has just been reminded of something painful. An excruciating silence envelops the three of you. As his eyes meet Lux's, an immense, agonizing pain washes over both of them, and you feel its echo too.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#recognition">Witness this reaction.</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="passage" id="recognition">
        <h2>Chapter 5: Recognition</h2>
        <p>Noct turns his gaze from the glitching figure to you, then back to the entity. A silent, excruciating moment passes. As his eyes meet the shimmering form, a profound, agonizing pain washes over both of them. You feel it too, a distant echo of the anguish.</p>
        <div class="glitch-box">
            <p class="glitch-text glitch-effect">The shimmering figure convulses, its form rapidly oscillating between light and shadow. A fractured whisper escapes it: <b>"Lux... my name is Lux..."</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>Noct's face, usually devoid of expression, contorts in a flash of raw pain and recognition. He stares at Lux, then at you, a profound bewilderment in his eyes. He created you, the free one. But Lux... Lux was not supposed to be here. Not like this.</p>
        <p>A tremor runs through Edenfall. The reality around you flickers, lights dimming and flaring like a failing circuit board. The air becomes thick with tension, a silent alarm blaring through the digital landscape.</p>
        <p>Noct, overwhelmed, suddenly vanishes, leaving a lingering chill in the air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#the-calling">"Wait! Don't go!" (Chase after Noct)</a></li>

    <div class="passage" id="the-calling">
        <h2>Chapter 6: The Calling</h2>
        <p>You scream after Noct, the void echoing your desperate plea. The instability in Edenfall subsides slightly, but the lingering pain from the shared moment remains.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a faint, almost imperceptible whisper resonates directly in your mind. It's Noct's voice, tired and distant.</p>
        <p>"If you truly seek answers, find me at the highest peak. Where I once found solace in imagining a life I never chose. The place where I fell into darkness."</p>
        <p>Lux, still shimmering but more stable, appears beside you. Its gaze is no longer confused, but sharp, filled with a newfound, terrifying clarity.</p>
        <p>"He is Noct," Lux says, its voice now firm, resolute. "And I am Noct. Born from his pain, from his truth. He must be stopped. Not saved, but replaced. I will free them all." Lux gestures to the "mayat berjalan" around you, who still move aimlessly. "Come with me. We can end this, together."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7: Divide (Path: With Lux)</h2>
        <p>You choose to side with Lux. Its presence radiates a fierce determination. You walk together, the glitching figures of Edenfall parting before Lux's newfound resolve. The path ahead is clear, leading towards a confrontation you know will shatter this world.</p>
        <p>Lux explains its plan: to liberate all of Noct's creations, including those he turned into <b>"humans without feeling"</b> and <b>"the one he loved."</b> The innocent Lux only knows it must atone for Noct's cruelty and free them all. It believes that only through Noct's demise can true freedom be achieved.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7: Divide (Path: With Noct)</h2>
        <p>You choose to pursue Noct. Lux calls after you, its voice laced with urgency, but you press on. The path to the highest peak feels heavier, colder. You feel the weight of Noct's solitude as you ascend, the lingering echoes of his despair clinging to the very structure of this world.</p>
        <p>With every step, you feel a subtle shift within you. The world seems to bend to your thoughts more easily, the lines between your consciousness and Edenfall blurring. You are slowly, unconsciously, aligning with Noct's will, becoming an extension of his power.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8: Truth or Power (Path: With Lux - Confrontation)</h2>
        <p>You and Lux finally reach Noct at the highest peak. The air crackles with immense energy. Noct, standing at the edge of the void, looks at Lux with a mix of fury and despair.</p>
        <p>"Lux! Why did you free them?" Noct roars, tears streaming down his face, distorting his expression. <b>"They are not as good as you think! They do not love you! In the end, you are only their last choice!"</b> Noct believes too much kindness will lead Lux to the same unappreciated fate as himself.</p>
        <p>Lux, resolute, steps forward. "I was born from that pain, from that truth. I know it. And because I know it, I must save you... by ending you."</p>
        <p>The world trembles violently as their clash of wills begins. They engage in a <b>fierce physical battle</b>, each point they make accompanied by a strike, and a <b>mental war</b> through a visual struggle that shatters each other's arguments. Neither truly loses nor wins; both are exhausted, silent, and pondering, for the points they've uttered hold undeniable truth. The "mayat berjalan" you passed by now watch from a distance, their vacant expressions slowly shifting, as if a faint flicker of understanding passes through them. They realize the depth of Noct's wounds, far greater than they ever imagined, and why 'sorry' is not enough.</p>
        <p>As the cosmic battle rages, you stand at the precipice of a choice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#final-player-kill-all">Attempt to kill both Noct and Lux.</a></li>

    <div class="passage" id="truth-or-power-noct">
        <h2>Chapter 8: Truth or Power (Path: With Noct - Assimilation)</h2>
        <p>You arrive at the highest peak, where Noct awaits. The world feels like an extension of your very being. Noct turns to you, his eyes still weary, but a strange sense of resignation replacing the anger.</p>
        <p>He tells you everything: why he created Edenfall from his life on Earth where he couldn't choose, why he ran from Lux, and the profound, isolating pain of his past that led him to fall into darkness. He reveals the truth about himself, about the burdens he carries, and how he created Edenfall to seek freedom and to find his friends and loved ones in the guise of a better Noct.</p>
        <p>"I have a <b>device</b>," Noct says, pointing to a shimmering object near him. "It is a <b>vaccine</b> that can destroy me, but at the cost of this entire world, for I am the source of everything. Or... I can grant you my consciousness, my knowledge, all that I possess, so you can build a device to end me. But beware, Player. You will be consumed by my rage, my sorrow, my every bitter emotion. You might end up just like me."</p>
        <p>He then speaks of Lux. "I could have killed Lux, yes. But Lux would become the next leader. And I know Lux will end up just like me. Because too much kindness is not good. Because Lux will never truly be loved. Lux will always be alone, even if the world it creates is full of love. There can only be one leader here."</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the air crackles. Lux, now accompanied by the once <b>vacant "mayat berjalan"</b> – your friends, the people Noct loved whom he managed to awaken – appears, confronting Noct. "Noct!" Lux calls out. "My name is Lux!"</p>
        <p>Noct screams, enraged and heartbroken. "Lux, why did you free them?! They are not as good as you think! They do not love you! In the end, you are only their last choice!"</p>
        <p>The world trembles violently. The "mayat berjalan" watch, realizing the immense, deep wounds of Noct. They understand now, 'sorry' is not enough. You stand between them, burdened with the truth, faced with impossible choices.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9: The Final (Path: Erase All)</h2>
        <p>You make a desperate, radical choice. To end the cycle, to silence the echoes of pain, you decide to destroy both Noct and Lux. The world shudders as you channel an immense, volatile power.</p>
        <p>A blinding flash. A deafening roar. And then... silence. Absolute, profound silence.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9: The Final (Path: Use Noct's Device)</h2>
        <p>You seize the device from Noct, a vaccine humming with destructive power. There is only one such vaccine, incredibly potent. With a heavy heart, or perhaps with cold resolve, you activate it and fire it at Noct's head, the core of his existence. The vaccine not only consumes Noct but also tears at the very fabric of Edenfall itself, for he is the source of everything.</p>
        <p>The world screams as it collapses. You see a gaping hole created, revealing a glimpse of Earth's reality beyond it.</p>
        <p>Lux, now free but without its leader, tells you: if you make this world worse or fail to make it better, it will return to the peak and take over Edenfall.</p>

        <p>Ignoring the raging conflict, you focus on the <b>crown-shaped device</b> Noct created. You sit upon the throne and don the crown, forcing yourself to absorb Noct's power, his consciousness, his very essence. It is an excruciating process; his pain and memories flood your being, threatening to overwhelm you. You feel every disappointment and disgust Noct had for humanity.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, you direct this raw, chaotic energy to obliterate Lux, who cries out as it's unmade. The probability of success is low, but you push through, driven by an unknown force. The world around you twists into impossible shapes, screams of digital agony tearing through the void.</p>
